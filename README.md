ðŸš€ Hello! I'm Sai Karthick

A Lead Unity Developer specializing in creating immersive AR/VR experiences and gamified applications. With over 7 years in the industry, my passion is at the intersection of game design and technology, building robust gameplay systems from the ground up. With a background in both hands-on development and team leadership, I ensure projects are delivered with technical excellence and creative integrity.



ðŸ’¼ Leadership & Management

As a Lead Developer in a fast-paced startup environment, I successfully guided and mentored a team of developers, overseeing the entire project lifecycle. My responsibilities included:



Agile Development: Acting as a Scrum Master, I planned and executed sprints to ensure efficient, on-time delivery.

Team Mentorship: I provided direct guidance and support to junior developers, fostering their growth and ensuring high-quality output.

Cross-functional Coordination: I collaborated closely with backend and design teams to ensure seamless integration and a unified project vision.

ðŸŽ® Featured Projects

My work demonstrates a deep technical understanding of game development, from core mechanics to advanced systems and networking.



VR Training Simulators: As the primary developer for a suite of enterprise applications, I designed and built comprehensive VR training simulators for work safety. These projects leveraged advanced game physics and cross-platform optimization to create realistic and impactful experiences.

Next-Gen World & Character Design: I led a project that explored cutting-edge Unreal Engine features to push the boundaries of real-time graphics. This included implementing a fluid character animation system using Motion Matching, creating dynamic destruction with Chaos Physics, and building highly detailed, performant environments with Nanite and Lumen. The project also incorporated MetaHuman characters to achieve a high level of visual fidelity.

High-Fidelity Gameplay Systems: My portfolio includes custom-built gameplay systems such as a physics-driven procedural rope system and an AI NPC with custom interactions powered by a Large Language Model (LLM).

Multiplayer & Live Services: I have a proven track record of creating robust multiplayer experiences using SDKs like Photon, and I have a deep understanding of render streaming and low-latency communication protocols like Web RTC and CloudXR.
